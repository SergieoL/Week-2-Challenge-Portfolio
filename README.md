# Week-2-Challenge-Portfolio

This portfolio web page includes my name and a recent photo of me at the top.

It inlucdes a navigation bar which when clicked leads to my 'About Me', 'Work', and 'Contact', section of the webpage.

The navigation bar also includes a 'Resume' button which when click downloads a copy of my Resume.

The body of my portfolio includes an about me section, my work, and contact information.

In my 'Work' section, each placeholder image links to my github when clicked. This will eventually be replaced by my deployed projects when finished.

My portfolio has been adapted to be viewed on different screen sizes and the layout reflects that.
